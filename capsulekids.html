        </div>
        <div class="process-step">
            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>These are the steps I took in the design and production of my Comet and Bubbl PVC figure charms!
                Comet and Bubbl are space themed characters I created as part of my “Capsule Kids” series. I was
                inspired
                to make a product similar in feel to the vintage charms and toys that I love to collect.</p>

        <div class="process-step">
            <h1>Sketching</h1>
            <p>My designs are inspired by the toys and collectibles that fill my room. Pulling from
                various sources of inspiration, I begin the process with rough pencil sketches. Since
                the designs will be tightened up in the next step, I sketch only until I have a solid
                enough idea of the characters' overall direction and personality.</p>

        <div class="process-step">
            <h1>3D Modeling</h1>
            <p>Once I have a solid enough concept on paper, I begin 3D modeling in Blender. I work with the designs
                until I have finalized figure concepts. This usually takes a lot of tinkering and revisions. I also
                collect renders that I will need for later steps in the process.</p>

        <div class="process-step">
            <h1>Prototyping</h1>
            <p>I then 3D print some resin prototypes so I can have a good idea for how the designs feel as physical
                products. I make final decisions on the sizing and level of detail I should include in
                the final designs.</p>

        <div class="process-step">
            <h1>Technical Sheets</h1>
            <p>I prepare tech sheets with the finalized concepts that I will provide to my manufacturer. I detail
                physical dimensions and color selections.
                I provide renders from multiple views of the figures that that the manufacturer can reference to ensure
                design accuracy in the final products.</p>

        <div class="process-step">
            <h1>Packaging Design</h1>
            <p>I decided to go with blister style packaging for this figure series. I designed these backing cards in
                Photoshop.
                Pictured below are the front and back sides for both characters. A plastic "bubble" which houses
                the figures will be fitted onto these cards for the final products.

        <div class="process-step">
            <h1>3D Animation</h1>
            <p>At this stage, the figure and packaging designs will have been submitted to the manufacturer
                for full production. While the figures are in production, I work on the 3D animation that will serve as
                the promo for the figures before their release. Making these animations really helps to build
                familiarity and connections with the characters. Here is the finished video!

            <h1>Finished Products!</h1>
            <p>I receive the finished products in the mail! This part is always very exciting for me. It's always
                a joy to see my designs come to life like this. I take product photos and clean them up in
                Photoshop for use on my webshop and instagram in preparation for their release.
